						** AppDev2: Assignment No. 1 **


	1. Introduction (100-150 words)

		I am Jean Rose Talen, from BSIS 3rd-year. I was once into programming when it was my first year in college. 
	I learned Java programming back then. When I learned Java I thought I wanted to pursue a programming or development 
	career because it was easier for me to understand Java syntax, I guess. However, it was not the same with other programming 
	languages. I honestly lost the passion to continue learning programming because it became so much harder for me to understand 
	and to create logic using the syntax from that language. I think I already had experience with backend development but it was 
	just the basics, when we had to make an atm machine process. When it comes to Node.js, we used it during the appdev1 course as 
	it stands as the environment in order for us to create React apps.



	2. Course Expectations (200-300 words)

		I really want to learn some techniques (if there's any) on how creating logic or manipulating syntax could be easier for me, 
	as someone who can somehow read codes but for some reason cannot create on my own. I also want to have a better understanding on how 
	the server side works behind the scenes. I'd also like to learn those specific skills mentioned above, that are related to what we are 
	going to discuss in this course. But most importantly, I want to learn how they can work together to form the backend of a system. 
	I want to understand and I want to be able to create a system from it. 

		Just like what has been discussed in the introduction of this course. I want to learn skills that are currently on-demand in 
	the IT industry. So that, I can be aware and I will know how I can adapt to the rapid changes that are happening in the IT industry. 
	Also, learning to create backend development will be a great help for me because that will make me able to contribute with my group mates 
	in activities or projects, and with my own.

		I think that the knowledge I will be acquiring from learning in this course will be a great help for me, in finding the path 
	I want to pursue with my career. And this will help me understand what field I really am meant to be.



	3. Challenges and Areas for Improvement (150-200 words)

		There are a lot of topics that I really find difficult but all of those is what I want to improve on. I find it hard to 
	familiarize myself with the programming language that we're using, because even though I understand that we're just using the same 
	functions, loops, and conditional components, I still find it hard to use them in different environment and in different conditions. 
	Those mentioned above are just some examples of the many things I struggle to have a better understanding in this course.

		Since, I want to learn how I can be better in working with databases, the most efficient way I can to use it properly, 
	I want to learn how to build APIs and be able to create one on my own, and I want to learn the topics that we are going to 
	discuss in this course. I will be more attentive in listening during discussion, participate in every hands-on activities, 
	and maybe even learn on my own with every resources available on the internet.


 
	4. Expectations from the Instructor (100-150 words)

		Rather than expectation, since I already know that you're doing your best to teach us what you know and your expertise. 
	I wish for you Sir to continue being patient with us. Since the introduction, I'm expecting to learn the fundamentals of the course 
	from you Sir. And I'd like it if we'll have a slower pace of discussion in areas that are really hard for a beginner to understand quickly. 

		I learn fast with hands-on tutorials or with coding examples being demonstrated. However, I still have to understand why we 
	are using a particular syntax. So, it will be easier for me to use that in coding. Aside from coding examples, I'd like it if someone 
	is discussing every part of it with me, just like what you have been doing in our course Sir.
 


	5. Final Thoughts (Optional, 50-100 words)

		I would like to learn with less pressure. We're already surrounded with expectations and comparisons. So I would like 
	to have this course as my environment in learning with lesser pressure, because I'm finding it hard to cope up with people who 
	learns development faster than I can. But I still want to learn and be able to do it with my own with your help, Sir.
