Role Reflection 

// Your Role:

        I am currently one of the project managers for our group project. Keeping our project phase on schedule is my responsibility. 
    I also ensure the fulfillment of each deliverable and the alignment of our project with the system's objective. 
    As their project manager, I have to make sure that everybody in the team is on the same page, that we embrace our role, 
    and respect other members' roles in the project. However, keeping the group well-coordinated and well-communicated was a 
    huge challenge for me as someone so anxious in speaking to people, directing people, leading people, and managing them. 

        What I really wanted, in the beginning, was to treat everyone the same because they're all giving their best to contribute 
    to the project. However, just like what our instructor said in the ISPM class, you cannot treat every member the same way for all.
    It might be that the way you treat someone is not the way you should treat the other. We all have different personalities. 
    And to understand what is applicable for someone in your team is what's important. As someone who should act as the "mother" of 
    the group, I should be able to treat my members with what is appropriate for them so that we can communicate well and I can manage 
    them well.


//Teamwork Experience:

        It feels good to work with a team; you're secure that you don't have to be alone in delivering projects. 
    Working with my groupmates was an opportunity for me. I am able to work with people who really give their best when they are 
    set to do something.

        Honestly, I actually thought that our project was going well because we were all agreeing to one thing. 
    But because we lacked the time and resources, we somehow failed to meet the objective of our system. I realized that effective 
    communication and planning could have greatly improved our chances of success.Conducting daily meetings was a great idea because 
    I can ensure that everyone in the team is getting updates regarding the progress of our project. When it comes to delegating the 
    tasks, I made sure that everyone is communicating well with their workmate so that they are updated with the progress of each other. 
    Furthermore, I appreciated it that everybody in my group participated well.


//Personal Growth and Discipline:

        As a project manager, I want to improve my overall skill set. I want to be able to lead a team properly. 
    I want to show them that I can drive the project team to success. And I want to be skilled at least in this career.
